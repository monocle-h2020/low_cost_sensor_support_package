 Sitemark created guidelines the correctly use the DJI GSPro drone pilot app for data collection over water. This app works on ios systems. The flight guidelines are referenced here: https://github.com/monocle-h2020/low_cost_sensor_support_package/blob/master/Monocle%20Flight%20Guidelinesv12020704_update.pdf
To support drone pilots in their flight mission planning, Sitemark  created a website (called MONOCLE Flight Planner) to help define coordinates for the drone to hover in order to capture a certain buoy and in function of the position of the sun.
